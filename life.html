    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 29px;">Seek help when needed: Don't be afraid to ask your teachers or classmates for help if you're struggling with a particular concept or assignment.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 29px;">Stay motivated: Stay focused on your goals and maintain a positive attitude towards learning. Reward yourself for your achievements and stay committed to improving your grades.
